This is experimental repo for Aurora-Sim installers/configurators.

Standalone Configurator (Windows/Linux)

Standalone Configurator allows you to easily configure your Aurora-Sim in Standalone mode, both with or without external access.

Aurora-Sim Configurator will set all your *.ini files to match your needs of a Standalone region for Windows or Linux

Just drop the AuroraConf.Standalone.exe in your Aurora-Sim/bin folder and start it.

If you need to re-configure you Aurora-Sim, just run the configurator again.

TOD : Grid mode, HG/IWC mode, WebUI Installer, Optional Modules Installer.

Enjoy!
Rico.
